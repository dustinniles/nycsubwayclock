## Features

- 🚇 Real-time subway arrival data from MTA GTFS feeds
- 🎨 Custom MTA font for authentic subway line bullets
- 🔀 Direction-based display showing both directions simultaneously
- ⚡ Efficient, lightweight code optimized for Raspberry Pi
- 🔧 Easy configuration via `.env` file - no code editing required
- 📝 Comprehensive logging for debugging
- 🔄 Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- 📦 Clean, modular code structure

## Display Format

The display shows upcoming trains separated by direction:
- **Line 1**: Northbound trains (e.g., "Ma A 3m, C 5m, E 7m")
- **Line 2**: Southbound trains (e.g., "Bk F 2m, Q 6m")

Direction labels are customizable using 2-letter borough codes (Ma=Manhattan, Bk=Brooklyn, Qn=Queens, Bx=Bronx, Si=Staten Island). Note: Use lowercase for the second letter as the custom MTA font may not support all uppercase letters.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (tested on Pi 4B)
- RGB LED Matrix (this project uses 2 chained 32x64 matrices = 128x32 display)
- Adafruit RGB Matrix HAT or Bonnet
- 5V Power Supply for the LED matrices

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dustinniles/nycsubwayclock.git
cd nycsubwayclock
```

**Note**: The `--recursive` flag is important to pull the required submodules (nyct-gtfs and rpi-rgb-led-matrix).

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install RGB matrix library (follow their instructions)
cd rpi-rgb-led-matrix
make build-python
cd ..
```

### 3. Configure Your Display

Edit the `.env` file to customize for your setup:

```bash
# Subway Configuration - Change these for your stops!
SUBWAY_ROUTE=C                    # Your subway line (A, C, E, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
STOP_IDS=A44N,A44S                # Stop IDs (northbound, southbound)
MAX_TRAINS_PER_DIRECTION=3        # Max trains to show per direction
MAX_MINUTES_AWAY=30               # Max minutes out to display

# Direction Labels (2-letter borough codes - lowercase second letter)
DIRECTION_NORTH_LABEL=Ma          # Label for northbound (Ma, Bk, Qn, Bx, Si)
DIRECTION_SOUTH_LABEL=Bk          # Label for southbound

# Display Timing
DISPLAY_REFRESH_CYCLE=5           # Seconds between display refreshes

# Matrix Hardware - Adjust for your LED matrix setup
MATRIX_ROWS=32                    # Rows per matrix panel
MATRIX_COLS=64                    # Columns per matrix panel
MATRIX_CHAIN_LENGTH=2             # Number of chained panels
MATRIX_GPIO_SLOWDOWN=3            # GPIO slowdown (4 for Pi 4B, 3 for Pi 3)
```

**Finding Your Stop IDs:**
Stop IDs can be found in the MTA GTFS data. For example:
- A44N/A44S = Clinton-Washington (C line, Brooklyn)
- Look up your stop in `nyct-gtfs/nyct_gtfs/gtfs_static/stops.txt`

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

Logs will be written to `logs/subway_clock.log`.

**For 24/7 operation:** See [RUNNING_CONTINUOUSLY.md](RUNNING_CONTINUOUSLY.md) for setting up auto-start on boot, monitoring, and maintenance recommendations.

## Configuration Options

All configuration is done through the `.env` file. Here are the available options:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `SUBWAY_ROUTE` | Subway line to display (A, C, E, 1, 2, etc.) | C |
| `STOP_IDS` | Comma-separated stop IDs | A44N,A44S |
| `MAX_TRAINS_PER_DIRECTION` | Maximum trains to show per direction | 3 |
| `MAX_MINUTES_AWAY` | Maximum minutes out to show | 30 |
| `DIRECTION_NORTH_LABEL` | Label for northbound direction (2 letters, lowercase 2nd) | Ma |
| `DIRECTION_SOUTH_LABEL` | Label for southbound direction (2 letters, lowercase 2nd) | Bk |
| `DISPLAY_REFRESH_CYCLE` | Seconds between display refreshes | 5 |
| `MATRIX_ROWS` | LED matrix rows | 32 |
| `MATRIX_COLS` | LED matrix columns | 64 |
| `MATRIX_CHAIN_LENGTH` | Number of chained panels | 2 |
| `MATRIX_GPIO_SLOWDOWN` | GPIO slowdown (3-4 for Pi 3/4) | 3 |
| `FONT_PATH` | Path to MTA font file | MTA.ttf |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING) | INFO |
| `LOG_MAX_BYTES` | Max log file size before rotation | 10485760 (10MB) |
| `LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` | Number of old log files to keep | 5 |

## Customization Examples

### Different Subway Line

To display the A train at your local stop:

```bash
SUBWAY_ROUTE=A
STOP_IDS=A42N,A42S  # Your stop IDs
```

### Single Matrix Panel

If you're using just one 64x32 matrix:

```bash
MATRIX_ROWS=32
MATRIX_COLS=64
MATRIX_CHAIN_LENGTH=1
```

### Different Raspberry Pi Model

For Raspberry Pi 3 or older:

```bash
MATRIX_GPIO_SLOWDOWN=3
```

For Raspberry Pi 4:

```bash
MATRIX_GPIO_SLOWDOWN=4
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No trains available"
- Check your `SUBWAY_ROUTE` matches your `STOP_IDS`
- Verify stop IDs are correct in `stops.txt`
- Check logs at `logs/subway_clock.log`

### Display flickering
- Try adjusting `MATRIX_GPIO_SLOWDOWN` (increase the value)
- Ensure adequate power supply to LED matrices

### Import errors
- Make sure you cloned with `--recursive` flag
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Permission errors on Raspberry Pi
- Run with sudo if needed: `sudo python main.py`
- Check file permissions
